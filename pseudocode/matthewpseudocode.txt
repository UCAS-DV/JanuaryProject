Current times is a tuple
Current timeframes is a list

Days is equivalent to the user inputting an integer of how many days will the festival be?

Define the function of update current times
	Timeframe count is equivalent to timeframes
	Time now is equivalent to start time (countable variable pt 2)
	Time now hour is equivalent to start time (countable variable p3)
	Current times is equivalent to current times + time now
	Current times is equivalent to current times + time now hour
	While time now is less than or equal to end time
		Remainder is equivalent to timeframe count % 2
		If remainder is equivalent to 1
			Time now hour is equivalent to time now hour + 1
		Else if remainder is equivalent to 0
			Time now is equivalent to time now + .30

If the number of days is greater than or equal to the current count
	Ask the user for the start time of that day
	Ask the user for the end time of that day
	Timeframes is equivalent to end time minus start time, divided by 2.
	Update current timeframes to have these timeframes
	Run the function of starting current times
	Ask the user for how many performances there will be in that day

Define the function of performance in day
If there is another performance in the number of performances there will be in the day
	Ask the user what time they want the performance to start (military time (minutes are decimal)
Ask the user what time they want the performance to end (military time (minutes are decimal)
	
		If that performance time is clear
Make it so that the timeframe is not available anymore, also add 1 more timeframe as an intermission
			Update current times
		Else if the performance time is not clear
			Tell the user that that performance time is not clear
				Run the function of performance in day
